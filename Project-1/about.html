                <p class="section-text">The art of finger-weaving the Ceinture Fléchée originated with the Métis people, who perfected this technique in the villages surrounding Montreal and later in the Red River Settlement. Each sash requires extraordinary skill and patience, with a single piece taking over 200 hours to complete.</p>
                <p class="section-text">The distinctive arrow or chevron pattern that gives the sash its name is created through an intricate finger-weaving process known as the L'Assomption technique, named after the town where many of the finest weavers practice their craft.</p>

                <p class="section-text">The Métis sash serves numerous practical purposes that make it invaluable to voyageurs, traders, and frontiersmen. When wrapped around the waist, it provides crucial support during the arduous work of portaging canoes and carrying heavy packs. The sash can secure tools, hold a coat closed against bitter winds, or be fashioned into a tumpline for carrying loads.</p>
                <p class="section-text">In times of emergency, the sash becomes a lifeline - literally. It has been used as rope for climbing, as a tourniquet to staunch bleeding, and even as a sling for broken limbs. Yet despite these utilitarian functions, the Ceinture Fléchée remains a proud symbol of Métis identity and a mark of distinction in society.</p>
